This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How force the language by query param
Use the param **lng** which value could be **en**(English) or **de**(German), for example [http://localhost:3000/?lng=de](http://localhost:3000/?lng=de)

## Libraries I used
 - @material-ui/core and @material-ui/icons: Used to make the form beautiful.
 - i18next: Internalization library.
 - i18next-browser-languagedetector: Detect language by the browser.
 - react-i18next: Bind i18next to react.
 - simple-react-alert: Simple lib to show a custom alert.
